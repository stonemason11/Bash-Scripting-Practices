# Bash-Scripting-Practices
Most of the scripts are practices from "Advanced Bash Scripting Guide", Appendix A: Contributed Scripts
https://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/

After reading the book "Advanced bash scripting guide" by Mendel Cooper, I practiced the learned scripting techniques
by re-implementing the problems in Appendix A: Contributed Scripts. Some of them are written by myself, some of them are 
just a copy or mimic of the original script.
